                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <div class="bio">
                    <p>My first memory of expressing a deep fascination with technology was when I was 4 years old. My parents gifted me one of humanity's greatest achievements: the Nintendo 64. Motivated by the desire to play Super Smash Bros., I had to figure out how to connect the console to the TV. With a bit of help from my grandfather, we were able to get the composite RCA AV cable connected at both ends, and Super Smash Bros., in all its glory, was on fully display on the CRT.</p>
                    <p>The true test, however, came when a television did not have built-in RCA inputs. My desire to smash brothers was far too strong to be stopped by such a roadblock. Discovering the existence of alternative video cables for the N64 that utilized a coaxial cable was the breakthrough I needed. This moment of encountering a problem, assessing the situation, and identifying and trying out a solution is where gears started to turn.</p>
                    <p>If you're old enough to remember composite cables, perhaps you've had the opportunity to experiment with swapping the white and red audio cables and discover that they were interchangable. That for me was a core moment where I started to question how these cables worked at all, and what else was possible that I hadn't yet discovered.</p>
                    <p>Similar cases involving a desire to do something that involved technology and the need to understand it in order to get to the other side had presented themselves time and time again in life. Discovering the world of personal computing was like a never-ending feedback loop of fascination and discovery. Thankfully, this cycle has never stopped.</p>
                    <p>As of 2025, I've been in the tech industry for nearly a decade. I started as a helpdesk support technician at the <a href="https://islipny.gov/" target="_blank">Town of Islip</a>, and was given the freedom to learn, grow, and innovate. This freedom, coupled with my undying desire to improve and optimize my work, eventually lead me to writing code. Discovering the sheer impact and power that the ability of writing code provides was a turning point in my career.</p>
                    <p>In my personal time outside of work, I love to build applications that not only intrigue me, but ones that I believe others will find value in. Sanford Technologies is the organization through which I can share these applications with the world.</p>
